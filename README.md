## MOTIVATION‚úç
In recent years, the world has changed dramatically, with online teaching creating a virtual revolution in the world of education. However, online teaching has its own drawbacks, to jump in and out for endless tabs in the browser with different apps installed is tiring, we call it "Lost in the cloud". With minimal interaction and lengthy lectures, classes are becoming uninteractive repetition. We therefore aspire to produce a more convinient system and make learning more joyous.

## FUNCTIONALITIES‚ö°

So, for ease of learning we thought of bringing everything together under one umbrella, to make the teaching process much easier and more fun for the teachers and the students as well.
This app will allow teachers to create a online room and invite the students to join. 

There the teacher can use the real-time whiteboard for illustration purposes. 

The app will also have a collapsable online editor for writing and running code. The editor will support languages like  C, CPP, CPP11, CLOJURE, C#, JAVA, JAVASCRIPT, HASKELL, PERL, PHP, PYTHON, RUBY.

The app will also have a dedicated section for real-time browsing so that the teacher can easily display the content of any website like Wikipedia, google docs, etc. just by providing the corresponding URL into the search box.

The teacher can create instant quizzes for interactive teaching and can see the responses submitted by each student. The teacher can also view the submission and accuracy of the whole class in the form of a pie-chart.

The students can access the notes of that room at any time as per his/her convenience. This reduces the burden of taking notes during online class, and students can primarily focus more on what the teacher says.
